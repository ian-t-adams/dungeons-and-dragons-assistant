# Dev Container Setup

This folder contains configuration for Visual Studio Code Dev Containers.

## Usage
- Open the project in VS Code.
- When prompted, "Reopen in Container" or use the Command Palette: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
- The container will be built using the backend's Dockerfile and will expose port 8000 for FastAPI.
- Python and Docker extensions are pre-installed for a smooth development experience.

## Customization
- Edit `devcontainer.json` to add more extensions, ports, or post-create commands as needed.
